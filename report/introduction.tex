This is an assignment report for the course 'Numerical Solutions for Differential Equations \RN{1}'. The assignment task is to create a Python package that implements a few of the numerical methods taught in the course. The package 'numerical-solver' is then used to solve a problem that is relevant to my D.Phil. project. The software techniques I used for the assignment will also be very useful for my D.Phil. project.

The package is hosted on Github, a good platform for version control and collaborations. Additionally, Jupyter notebooks were created to show how the package is used. The notebooks include codes using the package and their visual outputs, with explanatory texts. All examples and analysis of the numerical outputs will be presented in notebooks. They are available through links, indicated by underlined italic font, provided throughout the report. 

This report will start with the numerical methods and the use of the package to an example problem. The report then covers the code implementation, explaining the features of the package. Finally, the report includes the implementation of the package to solve a biological problem and its convergence analysis.
