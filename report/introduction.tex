This report describes the work undertaken as an assignment for the Numerical Solution for Differential Equations \RN{1} course given in the Mathematical Institute by Professor Endre S\"{u}li. It describes the implementation of a number of methods for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as an open source Python software package that I have developed and made available on GitHub. The package makes extensive use of software engineering techniques to ensure that the software is robust and fully tested.

I have also developed a number of tutorial examples as Jupyter Notebooks to explain how the methods work and to demonstrate their use on some real examples. They are available through links, indicated by underlined italic font, provided throughout the report.

The structure of this report is as follows: in Chapter \ref{chap:numerical-methods}, I describe the domain of ODEs and the numerical methods that I implement, and gives links to the software and tutorial notebooks for a simple test problem; Chapter \ref{chap:code-implementation} describes the implementation and testing of the software; Chapter \ref{chap:fitzhugh-nagumo} describes the application of the methods to the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model; and Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} gives some brief conclusions.
